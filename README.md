  <h1>STAKE_DICE_STAT</h1>
  <p>The <strong>Martingale Rule</strong> is a common strategy used to cover losses in gambling. Hereâ€™s how it works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you win a bet, you keep the bet amount the same.</li>
    <li>If you lose, you keep doubling the bet amount until you win.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> This strategy does not guarantee a win every time. Gambling is inherently risky, and it is advised not to gamble.</p>
  
  <h2>What Does My Code Do?</h2>
  <p>My code interacts with the stake API to place bets on dice games. The behavior is as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you win a bet, the bet amount remains the same.</li>
    <li>If you lose a bet, the bet amount is doubled until you win.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This automated process mimics manual betting but allows for continuous play over an extended period.</p>
  <p>Additionally, my code includes a condition to stop betting if there are 12 consecutive losses. While this is extremely rare, it is a precautionary measure.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Gambling is all about luck, and using this code does not alter the inherent risk involved.</p>
